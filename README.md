# Hill_Cipher

The program accepts an encryption key matrix and a plaintext file as input via command-line arguments. It processes the plaintext by converting it to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, and padding with 'x' if necessary to match the matrix size. The encryption is performed using matrix multiplication and modular arithmetic. The program outputs the key matrix, the processed plaintext, and the resulting ciphertext, formatted in rows of 80 characters.
